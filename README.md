# Wadaff

## The Concept
Passionate about music, but undecided about your friday night plans ? That is the reflection from which we started to prototype Wadaff ( Waar is da feestje ? ) with [B. Vander Stappen (DJ and nerd)](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vdsbenoit/), before COVID-19 happened...The features we started to develop include events mapping, real-time rating, and advanced filtering. Besides, we imagined such an app would the perfect opportunity for event organisators, bars, festivals to offer e-happy hours and many advantages.
